"""
This script asks the user (property agent) which city they can offer for Sarah to rent an apartment in.
Sarah has specific preferences based on the city:
- If the city is Washington, she hates it and will refuse to rent no matter the price.
- If the city is Chicago, she loves it so much that the price doesn't matterâ€”she'll take it.
- If the city is New York or San Francisco, Sarah will rent if the price is less than $4000.
- For any other city, Sarah will only rent if the price is $3000 or less.
The program then provides feedback on whether Sarah would rent based on the city and rent price.
